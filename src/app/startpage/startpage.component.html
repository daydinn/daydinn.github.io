        This demo application was developed by Diyar Aydin as part of his
        bachelor's project entitled "Development and Analysis of a Support App
        for Self-Optimization". It has been designed to answer the question of
        how a self-help application should be designed to help users achieve
        their personal goals and improve their quality of life. The focus of the
        project is on 3 aspects of self-optimisation, namely mental, physical
        and productive, represented by <span class="text-success">green </span>
        <span class="text-danger">red</span> and
        <span class="text-info">blue </span>colours.

      <p>
        The main points that distinguish this application from others are that
        it offers the user a completely personal and free experience. It allows
        users to prioritise their own preferences and create their own way of
        self-optimisation, which combined with its self-monitoring features can
        encourage users to be more self-aware and self-reflective. And it
        integrates different areas of self-optimisation with gamification
        elements on a single platform which can be used on both desktop and
        mobile. The design has been kept intimate and user-friendly to focus on
        the main use.

          However, it should be kept in mind that this is not a full
          application, but rather a prototype implementation to better
          understand user preferences and the effectiveness of such an
          application. There may be some performance and loading issues.</span
